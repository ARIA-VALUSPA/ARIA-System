No. Carroll did not use drugs while writing the story. 
The larger part of the story was invented when he was on a boat trip with a friend, the real Alice and her sisters. 
He invented it while they rowed. The drug rumour was first spread in the 1960's by supporters of the then new LSD subculture. 
The rumour is believed to have originated from the psychiatrists who introduced LSD into our society. 
There is indeed one part in the book that may describe the use of drugs: the hookah smoking Caterpillar who advises Alice to eat from the mushroom. But with the story Carroll made fun of all aspects of society, and it may be possible that he was just reflecting the age with this part. 
In the Victorian era there were no drug laws like we know them. Opium, cocaine, and laudanum (a painkiller that contained opium) were used for medicinal purposes, and could be obtained from a pharmacist (mind that LSD was not yet invented at the time!). So in Carroll's days it was not uncommon to experience the effect of being 'high', whether or not accidentally. 
However, it was definitely not Carroll's intention to write a book about drugs: he wanted to entertain a little girl whom he loved. The chapter about the hookah smoking caterpillar wasn't even part of the original story; it was added later when Carroll decided to publish it. 
Some people insist that one has to be on drugs to write such a creative story.
