The Cheshire Cat is unique among Wonderland creatures. 
Threatened by no one, it maintains a cool, grinning outsider status. 
The Cheshire Cat has insight into the workings of Wonderland as a whole. 
Its calm explanation to Alice that to be in Wonderland is to be “mad” reveals a number of points that do not occur to Alice on her own. 
The Cheshire Cat points out that Wonderland as a place has a stronger cumulative effect than any of its citizens.
