No. When the Alice books were published, they were copyright protected until 42 years after the first publication or 7 years after the author's death, whichever was the longer. 
Later, the 1911 Act replaced the 1842 Copyright Act which extended the period to 50 years after the author's death.
This means that the copyright on "Alice's Adventures in Wonderland" subsisted until 1907 and that of "Through the Looking-Glass and what Alice found there" until 1948. 
As Tenniel died in 1914, his illustrations came out of copyright in 1964. 
Disney's cartoon movie still remains in copyright. 
If you wish to use movie stills, video, audio, or anything else from the movie, you'll need to ask permission from Disney Consumer Products (500 S. Buena Vista, Burbank, CA 91521-6781).
