No, The Dormouse never says that in the book, nor in Disney's movie. 
Either Jefferson Airplane made it up, or we should interpret the lyrics differently. Perhaps the line "Remember what the dormouse said" stands on its own, in stead of being connected to the next line, "Feed your head, feed your head". The first line may be general advice about remembering what it said. 
It may even refer to a specific conversation in the chapter about the trial: 
`Well, at any rate, the Dormouse said--' the Hatter went on, looking anxiously round to see if he would deny it too: but the Dormouse denied nothing, being fast asleep.
`After that,' continued the Hatter, `I cut some more bread- and-butter--'
`But what did the Dormouse say?' one of the jury asked.
`That I can't remember,' said the Hatter.
