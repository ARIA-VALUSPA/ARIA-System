jabberwocky
The Jabberwock is a fictional character from the novel Through the Looking-Glass, and What Alice Found There by Lewis Carroll. 
It only appears within the poem Jabberwocky that Alice reads during the first chapter and never interacts with the rest of the cast.
The Jabberwock is commonly (and incorrectly) referred to as the Jabberwocky, though Jabberwocky is the title of the poem, rather than the name of the creature, as seen in the original poem, reproduced below.
