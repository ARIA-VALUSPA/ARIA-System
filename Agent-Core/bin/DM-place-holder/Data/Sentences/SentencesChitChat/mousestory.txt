As Lewis Caroll wrote it :  Fury said to a mouse, That hemet in the house, 
"Let usboth go to law:  I will prosecuteYOU.  
Come, I'll take no denial;
We must have a trial:  For really this morning I've nothing to do."
Said the mouse to the cur, "Such a trial, dear Sir, 
With no jury or judge, would be wasting our breath." 
"I'll be judge, I'll be jury,"
Said cunning old Fury:
"I'll try the whole cause, and condemn you to death."'
