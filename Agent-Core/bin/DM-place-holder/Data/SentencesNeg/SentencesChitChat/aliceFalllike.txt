alice fall

During her fall, Alice only think about her knowledge. She is wondering if she is going to the center of the Earth, or to Australia or New-Zeeland.
She doesn't seem to be afraid at all... She even falls asleep ! 
Luckily, after the long fall, she is not hurt at all ! 
If I was her, I guess I will be really afraid, and I will never fall asleep like that. I will probably scream !
