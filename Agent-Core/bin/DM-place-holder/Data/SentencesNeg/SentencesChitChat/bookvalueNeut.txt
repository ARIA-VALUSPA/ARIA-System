No. Unfortunately there is no "price guide" to determine the current value of antiquarian books. 
The value of your edition depends on a lot of different factors. 
As I am not an antiquarian bookseller, I have no knowledge of appraising or dating old books, and can only advise you to visit a reputable antiquarian book dealer in your vicinity.
