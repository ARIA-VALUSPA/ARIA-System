No, probably not. He certainly liked little girls at a level that was more than normal. 
However, there is no evidence at all that he was sexually attracted to them. 
He did photograph them in the nude, but only with permission from their mothers, and only if the children were completely at ease with it. 
He made sure that after his death those pictures were destroyed or returned to the children to prevent them from getting embarrassed. 
In his time making nude photographs of children wasn't uncommon; all Victorian artists did studies of child-nudes, it was a trendy subject for the time. 
When his child-friends grew up, they told only positive stories about their warm friendship. 
It is suggested that Carroll loved little girls so much because he had many sisters which he loved to entertain when he was a young boy.
