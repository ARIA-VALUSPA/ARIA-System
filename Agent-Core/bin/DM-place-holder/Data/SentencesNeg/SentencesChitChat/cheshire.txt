I see that you are not in a great mood. Shall I tell you a story about The Cheshire Cat to cheer you up?
The Cheshire Cat is unique among Wonderland creatures. 
Threatened by no one, it maintains a cool, grinning outsider status. 
The Cheshire Cat has insight into the workings of Wonderland as a whole. 
Certainly, Alice’s burning curiosity to absorb everything she sees in Wonderland sets her apart 
from the other Wonderland creatures, making her seem mad in comparison.
