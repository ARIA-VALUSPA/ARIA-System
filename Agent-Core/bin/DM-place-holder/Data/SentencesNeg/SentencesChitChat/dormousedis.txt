I see that you are not in a great mood. Shall I tell you a story about the Dormouse to cheer you up?
The Dormouse sat between the March Hare and the Hatter. They were using him, while he slept, as a cushion when Alice arrives at the start of the chapter.
The Dormouse is always falling asleep during the scene, waking up every so often.
