I see that you are not in a great mood. Shall I tell you a story about the Gryphon to cheer you up?
A servant to the Queen who befriends Alice. 
The Gryphon escorts Alice to see the Mock Turtle.
He appears to be somewhat overbearing and dismissive of the obsessions and dismays of other characters, such as the Mock Turtle's sorrow and the Queen of Hearts' executions, neither of which, according to the Gryphon have any basis in fact.
