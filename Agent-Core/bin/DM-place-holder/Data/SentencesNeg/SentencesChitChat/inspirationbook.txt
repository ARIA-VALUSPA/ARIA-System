The story goes that in July, 1862, Charles Dodgson - a maths lecturer at Christ Church - was rowing the three young daughters of his friend Henry Liddell up the River Isis for a picnic.
He made up a story to entertain them, using the name of 10-year-old Alice for the girl who falls down a rabbit hole.
