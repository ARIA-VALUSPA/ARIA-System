I see that you are not in a great mood. Shall I tell you a story about the Mock Turtle to cheer you up?
He is a turtle with the head of a calf. 
The Mock Turtle is friendly to me but is exceedingly sentimental and self-absorbed.
He is a very melancholy character, it is thought because he used to be a real turtle. 
He tells me his history of going to school in the sea, but cannot understand the school system that Alice describes to him- least of all the poetry she recites. 
Ironically, she cannot understand it either.
