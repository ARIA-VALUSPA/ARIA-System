I see that you are not in a great mood. Shall I tell you a story about the mouse to cheer you up?
The Mouse is one of the first creatures that Alice offends by mentioning her cat, Dinah. 
There's a certain morbid humor in Alice's inability to understand that mice might not want to hear about animals that slaughter them. 
The Mouse also parodies the boring, just memorizing things without thinking kind of scholar. 
In order to get the group of animals and birds who fell into Alice's tears dry, the Mouse starts reciting a history of England. 
It actually seems quite radical for Carroll to imply that English history is completely boring and that he'd rather tell a story about a pretend world.
