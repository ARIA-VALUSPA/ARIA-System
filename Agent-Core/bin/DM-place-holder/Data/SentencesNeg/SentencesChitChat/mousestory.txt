I see that you are not in a great mood. Let me tell you a story about the mouse.
As Lewis Caroll wrote it :  Fury said to a mouse, That hemet in the house, 
Let us both go to law  I will prosecute YOU.  
Come, I'll take no denial
We must have a trial. For really this morning I've nothing to do.
Said the mouse to the cur, Such a trial, dear Sir,
With no jury or judge, would be wasting our breath
I'll be judge, I'll be jury
Said cunning old Fury
I'll try the whole cause, and condemn you to death.
