oyster
The old saying is that one should only eat an oyster during the months spelled with an "R". 
This was, historically, because summer months bring warmer waters and warmer waters bring spawning oysters and higher bacteria counts, which could be unhealthy or dangerous. Nowadays, with current cooling technology, there is nothing really wrong with eating a spawning oyster. 
So Mother Oyster recognizes that March is a good month for eating oysters and as she doesn't want her children to be eaten, she advises them to stay with her.
