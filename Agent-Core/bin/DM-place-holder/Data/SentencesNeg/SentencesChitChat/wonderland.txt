I see that you are not in a great mood. Let me tell you a story about Wonderland to cheer you up.
Wonderland is a world where Alice go after falling into the Rabbit Hole. 
It seems to look like a big garden where animals can talk just like humans.
The Cheshire Cat says to Alice that she would not have come there if she wasn't mad.
