There is discussion about whether the Alice books indeed used to be banned in China. 
It is said that it happened in 1931 by the Governor of Hunan Province, General Ho Chien, who found it an insult to humans to have animals acting in the same complex manner as a human, like using human language. His fear was that children would think humans and animals were equal and on the same level, which was 'disastrous'. 
The origin of the claim appears to be The File Room, a website dedicated to the cataloging of banned literature. They cite their source for the book being banned as "Banned Books 387 B.C. to 1978 A.D., by Anne Lyon Haight, and Chandler B. Grannis, R.R. Bowker Co, 1978.". 
However, further evidence is hard to find.
