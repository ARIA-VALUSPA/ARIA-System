I see that you are in the good mood for Alice's story in the Wonderland. 
Alice is a sensible prepubescent girl from a wealthy English family who finds herself in a strange world ruled by imagination and fantasy. 
Alice feels comfortable with her identity and has a strong sense that her environment is comprised of clear, logical, and consistent rules and features. 
Alice's familiarity with the world has led one critic to describe her as a disembodied intellect 
Alice displays great curiosity and attempts to fit her diverse experiences into a clear understanding of the world.
Alice approaches Wonderland as an anthropologist, but maintains a strong sense of noblesse oblige that comes with her class status. 
She has confidence in her social position, education, and the Victorian virtue of good manners. 
Alice maintains a superior attitude and behaves with solicitous indulgence toward those she believes are less privileged.
