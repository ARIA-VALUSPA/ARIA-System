Born on January 27, 1832 in Daresbury, Cheshire, England, Charles Dodgson wrote and created games as a child. 
At age 20 he received a studentship at Christ Church and was appointed a lecturer in mathematics. 
Dodgson was shy but enjoyed creating stories for children. 
His books including "Alice's Adventures in Wonderland" were published under the pen name Lewis Carroll. Dodgson died in 1898.
Carroll suffered from a bad stammer, but he found himself vocally fluent when speaking with children. 
The relationships he had with young people in his adult years are of great interest, as they undoubtedly inspired his best-known writings and have been a point of disturbed speculation over the years. 
Carroll loved to entertain children, and it was Alice, the daughter of Henry George Liddell, who can be credited with his pinnacle inspiration. 
Alice Liddell remembers spending many hours with Carroll, sitting on his couch while he told fantastic tales of dream worlds. 
During an afternoon picnic with Alice and her two sisters, Carroll told the first iteration of what would later become Alice's Adventures in Wonderland. 
When Alice arrived home, she exclaimed that he must write the story down for her.
He fulfilled the small girl's request, and through a series of coincidences, the story fell into the hands of the novelist Henry Kingsley, who urged Carroll to publish it. 
The book Alice's Adventures in Wonderland was released in 1865. 
It gained steady popularity, and as a result, Carroll wrote the sequel, Through the Looking-Glass and What Alice Found There (1871). 
By the time of his death, Alice had become the most popular children's book in England, and by 1932 it was one of the most popular in the world.
