No. Unfortunately there is no "price guide" to determine the current value of antiquarian books. 
The value of your edition depends on a lot of different factors. 
As I am not an antiquarian bookseller, I have no knowledge of appraising or dating old books, and can only advise you to visit a reputable antiquarian book dealer in your vicinity. 
For a start, you can take a look at the site of the ABAA, which contains a lot of information about the appraisal of old books. 
Start with this introduction to the evaluation of books. 
Their FAQ-page offers a lot of other useful information. Also check out the rest of the site, you'll find advise about how to locate an expert! 
Remember, however, that booksellers will seldom pay much more than 25% or 30% of a book's current retail price, because of their own high costs.
