I see that you are in the good mood for Alice's story in the Wonderland. Let's talk about The Caterpillar
The Caterpillar sits on a mushroom, smokes a hookah, and treats Alice with contempt. 
He directs Alice to the magic mushroom that allows her to shrink and grow.
Alice does not like the Caterpillar when they first meet, because he does not immediately talk to her and when he does, it is usually in short, rather rude sentences, or difficult questions.
