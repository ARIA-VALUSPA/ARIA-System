summary
Alice jumps to the White Rabbit’s call to the stand. She forgets that she has grown larger and knocks over the jury stand, then scrambles to put all of the jurors back. 
Alice claims to know “nothing whatever” about the tarts, which the King deems “very important.” The White Rabbit corrects the King, suggesting that he in fact means “unimportant.” 
The King agrees, muttering the words “important” and “unimportant” to himself.
The King interjects with Rule 42, which states, “All persons more than a mile high to leave the court.” 
Everyone turns to Alice, who denies she is a mile high and accuses the King of fabricating the rule. 
The King replies that Rule 42 is the oldest rule in the book, but Alice retorts that if it is the oldest rule in the book, it ought to be the first rule.
The King becomes quiet for a moment before calling for a verdict. The White Rabbit interrupts and declares that more evidence must be presented first.
He presents a paper supposedly written by the Knave, though it is not written in the Knave’s handwriting. The Knave refutes the charge, explaining that there is no signature on the document. 
The King reasons that the Knave must have meant mischief because he did not sign the note like an honest man would. 
The court seems pleased by this reasoning, and the Queen concludes that the paper proves the Knave’s guilt. Alice demands to read the poem on the paper. 
While the poem appears to have no meaning, the King provides an explanation and calls for a verdict. The Queen demands that the sentence come before the verdict. 
Alice chaffs at this proposal and criticizes the Queen, who calls for Alice’s beheading. Alice has grown to her full size and bats away the playing cards as they fly upon her.
Alice suddenly wakes up and finds herself back on her sister’s lap at the riverbank. 
She tells her adventures to her sister who bids her go inside for tea. Alice traipses off, while her sister remains by the riverbank daydreaming. 
She envisions the characters from Alice’s adventures, but knows that when she opens her eyes the images will dissipate. 
She imagines that Alice will one day grow older but retain her childlike spirit and recount her adventures to other children.
