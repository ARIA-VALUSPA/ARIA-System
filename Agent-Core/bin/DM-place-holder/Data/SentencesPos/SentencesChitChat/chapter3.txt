summary
Alice and the group of animals land on the bank and focus on getting dry. 
Alice begins arguing with the Lory, but the Mouse interjects and commands everyone to sit down and listen to a history lesson. 
The Mouse reasons that the story of William the Conqueror would be best since this story is the driest thing it knows.
After completing the story, Alice and the other animals are still wet, prompting the Dodo to suggest a Caucus race. 
The Dodo marks out a course, sets everyone in place, and yells “go.” 
The animals run around haphazardly until the Dodo declares half an hour later that the race is over. 
The Dodo says that all of them have won the Caucus race and elects Alice to confer prizes. 
Alice passes mints to all the animals, leaving herself without a prize. 
Finding a thimble, she hands it to the Dodo, who in turn presents it back to her as her prize. 
Alice solemnly accepts the thimble but cannot help feeling that the gesture is absurd.
After eating their mints, the Mouse declares that it will tell its tale. 
Alice confuses “tale” and “tail,” and focuses on the Mouse’s appendage as it talks about Fury prosecuting a mouse in court. 
The Mouse chides Alice for not paying attention, and though Alice apologizes, the two misunderstand each other and the Mouse leaves in a huff. 
The other animals lament the Mouse’s absence, and Alice mentions that she wishes her cat Dinah were there to bring the Mouse back. 
Alice continues to tell the animals that Dinah eats birds, which causes all of the animals to scatter in fear. 
Alone again, Alice begins to cry until she hears the distant pattering of footsteps.
