summary
Alice comes across a Caterpillar that is resting on top of a giant mushroom and smoking a hookah pipe. 
The two stare at each other in silence for a while before the Caterpillar asks Alice, “Who are you?” Alice has trouble explaining who she is to the antagonistic and contemptuous Caterpillar. 
Dejected, she turns to leave, but the Caterpillar calls her back to recite a poem. 
The Caterpillar duly notes that she recites the poem incorrectly and goes on to ask what size she would like to be. 
Alice states that being three inches tall is a wretched height, which insults the three-inch-tall Caterpillar. 
The Caterpillar crawls away in a huff, but not before telling Alice that eating one side of the mushroom will make her grow larger and eating the other side will make her grow smaller.
Alice tastes the right-hand portion of the mushroom and shrinks. 
She next tries part of the left-hand portion of the mushroom, and her neck grows so long that her head is above the treetops. 
Realizing she cannot get the other part of mushroom to her mouth, she attempts to reorient herself when a Pigeon attacks her.
The Pigeon has mistaken Alice for a serpent who wants to eat its eggs. 
Alice assures the Pigeon that she is not a serpent, and the Pigeon skulks back to its nest, leaving Alice to nibble at the two pieces of the mushroom until she returns to her original height. 
Back at her proper size, Alice wanders around the forest looking for the garden when she encounters a four-foot-tall house. 
She decides to visit the house and eats the portion of the mushroom to reduce her size to nine inches tall.
