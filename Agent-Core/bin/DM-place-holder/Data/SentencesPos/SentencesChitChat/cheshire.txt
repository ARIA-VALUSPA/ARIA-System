I see that you are in the good mood for Alice's story in the Wonderland. Let's talk about Cheshire
The Cheshire Cat is unique among Wonderland creatures. 
Threatened by no one, it maintains a cool, grinning outsider status. 
The Cheshire Cat has insight into the workings of Wonderland as a whole. 
Its calm explanation to Alice that to be in Wonderland is to be mad reveals a number of points that do not occur to Alice on her own. 
First, the Cheshire Cat points out that Wonderland as a place has a stronger cumulative effect than any of its citizens. 
Wonderland is ruled by nonsense, and as a result, Alice's normal behaviour becomes inconsistent with its operating principles,
so Alice herself becomes mad in the context of Wonderland.
