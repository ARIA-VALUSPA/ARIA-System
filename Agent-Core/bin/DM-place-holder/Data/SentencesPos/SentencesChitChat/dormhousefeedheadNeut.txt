dormouse jefferson song white rabbit ?
dormouse
No, The Dormouse never says that in the book, nor in Disney's movie. 
Either Jefferson Airplane made it up, or we should interpret the lyrics differently. 
Perhaps the line "Remember what the dormouse said" stands on its own, in stead of being connected to the next line, "Feed your head, feed your head". 
The first line may be general advice about remembering what it said.
