I see that you are in the good mood for Alice's story in the Wonderland. Let's talk about Mad Hatter
He is a small, impolite hatter who lives in perpetual tea-time. People even think that he has kill Time, the master of time, to be able to live in a perpetual tea-time !
The Mad Hatter enjoys frustrating Alice, and is quit rude with her.
