I see that you are in the good mood for Alice's story in the Wonderland. Let's talk about the Mouse
As Lewis Caroll wrote it :  Fury said to a mouse, That hemet in the house, 
Let us both go to law  I will prosecute YOU.  
Come, I'll take no denial
We must have a trial  For really this morning I've nothing to do.
Said the mouse to the cur, Such a trial, dear Sir
With no jury or judge, would be wasting our breath. 
I'll be judge, I'll be jury
Said cunning old Fury
I'll try the whole cause, and condemn you to death.
