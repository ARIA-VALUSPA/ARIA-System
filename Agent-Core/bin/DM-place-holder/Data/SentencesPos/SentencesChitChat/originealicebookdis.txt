origin
Mr. Dodgson would often take young Alice and her sisters Lorina (older) and Edith (younger) on leisurely rowing expeditions in the company of a fellow Oxford scholar. 
During these boat rides and subsequent picnics, he would make up fantastical tales to entertain the girls. What we now know as Aliceâ€™s Adventures in Wonderland began as one of these stories, and was only written down because Alice begged Mr. Dodgson to do it.
