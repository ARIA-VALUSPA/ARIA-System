I see that you are in the good mood for Alice's story in the Wonderland. Let's talk about the Queen
As the ruler of Wonderland, the Queen of Hearts is the character that Alice must inevitably face to figure out the puzzle of Wonderland. 
In a sense, the Queen of Hearts is literally the heart of Aliceâ€™s conflict. 
Unlike many of the other characters in Wonderland, the Queen of Hearts is not as concerned with nonsense and perversions of logic as she is with absolute rule and execution. 
In Wonderland, she is a singular force of fear who even dominates the King of Hearts.
