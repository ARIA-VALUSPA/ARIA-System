I see that you are in the good mood for Alice's story in the Wonderland
The frantic, harried Wonderland creature that originally leads me to Wonderland. 
The White Rabbit is figure of some importance, but he is manic, timid, and occasionally aggressive.
In the Disney movie, the rabbit is small and plump. 
He's notable for wearing a waistcoat and grayish periwinkle trouser when outside the castle grounds and is always seen with his massive-sized watch. 
He wears glasses and has eyes the color of pink and crimson pupils matching his nose and ear innards.
