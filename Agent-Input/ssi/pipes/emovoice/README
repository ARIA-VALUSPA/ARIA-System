Emotional speech classification either from a microphone or using input from a file.

To train a model run 'EMOVOICE_TRAIN.bat' (see docs/emovoice_train.mp4 and docs/emovoice_train.pdf).

Make sure to add a new user before you record your first session.

You may want to record several sessions to increase the robustness of your model.

After training use the 'Export Model' button to copy the model to models/<my-model>.

Edit 'emovoice.pipeline-config'
	> set model:emotion option to <my-model>.
	> to switch to live input set 'live=true'
	> to turn on activemq set 'activemq:use=true'

To change the output format of the pipeline open 'emovoice.xml' in a text editor

To run the pipeline execute EMOVOICE.bat

To test ActiveMQ connection run EMOVOICE_RECV.bat

-------------------------------------------------------------

To record videos of screen/user execute EMOVOICE_RECORD.bat, recorded files will be stored in capture/ (see camera.png how to set up camera)
