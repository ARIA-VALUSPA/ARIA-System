# Be really careful by changing this file.
# If you need to change one or more parameters,
# create a new `.ini` file with only the parameters to change (and their new values),
# and run the program with the new file in arguments.
# The two files will be loaded and the new values will be used.

# For programmers only: if you want to add a new parameter, it's here.
# But don't forget, if the parameter depends of the character used by the agent,
# you may use the characters `.ini` files and implement the interface
# CharacterDependent to be notified of any change of the character.

# Characters definitions:
# Don't change the two following lines:
